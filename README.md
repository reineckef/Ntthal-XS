# Ntthal-XS

This Perl module uses [Inline::C](https://metacpan.org/pod/Inline::C) 
to bind the ntthal alignment from the [primer3](https://github.com/primer3-org/primer3) 
code and make it available as a Perl subroutine call. It uses an object-oriented 
[Mouse](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mouse) interface.

The main motivation to do this was speed of execution, especially to _reduce overhead_ 
generated by process creation (fork) and passing of sequences, retrieval of results 
via shell process communication. See _BENCHMARK_ for results.

## INSTALLATION

To install this module, clone the code and run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Alternatively, you can download [the latest release](https://github.com/reineckef/Ntthal-XS/releases) and run:

	cpanm Ntthal-XS-#.#.#.tar.gz

Here, the # signs are placeholders for the version number.

The package will also install a demo/driver script named 
[ntthal_xs.pl](/bin/ntthal_xs.pl), which should be executable 
after installation. The purpose is to test the functionality 
and serve as a template for own code.

## SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Ntthal::XS;
my $NT = Ntthal::XS->new();

# tm will accept only one sequence
print $NT->tm('TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG'); # 44.5215658215416

# change parameters
$NT->type('END1');
$NT->dv(0.8);

# ntthal will use two sequences (different strands!)
my $hybrid = $NT->ntthal('CCCGAAAAGTGCCACCTG', 'CAGGTGGCATTTTTTCGGG');

# $hybrid = {
#    dG => -13335.3624649896,     # { 0}
#    dH => -132500,               # { 1}
#    dna_conc => 50,              # { 2}
#    dntp => 0.8,                 # { 3}
#    dS => -384.216145526392,     # { 4}
#    dv => 0.8,                   # { 5}
#    maxLoop => 8,                # { 6}
#    mv => 50,                    # { 7}
#    s1 => "CCCGAAAAGTGCCACCTG",  # { 8}
#    s2 => "CAGGTGGCATTTTTTCGGG", # { 9}
#    t => 42.0422986972263,       # {10}
#    temp => 37,                  # {11}
#    type => "END1",              # {12}
#  }
 
# compare to the ntthal command line output
#
#  ntthal -a END1 -dv 0.8 -s1 CCCGAAAAGTGCCACCTG -s2 CAGGTGGCATTTTTTCGGG
#  Calculated thermodynamical parameters for dimer:	dS = -384.216	dH = -132500	dG = -13335.4	t = 42.0423
#  SEQ	        G-

#  STR	GGGCTTTT  ACGGTGGAC
#  STR	        TT         
```

## BENCHMARK

Here, a comparison is shown for the traditional **ntthal** command line call, a newer version that 
does not read all parameter files at every call (it uses pre-populated lists) named **ntthal_new** 
and the **xs** version implemented here. *Note:* The underlying algorithm was __not changed__, only the 
overhead calling it from Perl was reduced.

```
Benchmark: timing 5000 iterations of ntthal, ntthal_new, xs...
    ntthal: 16 wallclock secs ( 0.18 usr  1.82 sys +  7.84 cusr  7.28 csys = 17.12 CPU) @ 292.06/s (n=5000)
ntthal_new: 10 wallclock secs ( 0.16 usr  1.22 sys +  5.09 cusr  3.38 csys =  9.85 CPU) @ 507.61/s (n=5000)
        xs:  2 wallclock secs ( 2.37 usr +  0.00 sys =  2.37 CPU) @ 2109.70/s (n=5000)
             Rate     ntthal ntthal_new         xs
ntthal      292/s         --       -42%       -86%
ntthal_new  508/s        74%         --       -76%
xs         2110/s       622%       316%         --
```
That is about a 4-fold improvement on my system.
